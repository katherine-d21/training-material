# Introduction

<!-- This is a comment. -->

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Metaproteomics {% cite Metaproteomics_video %}  is the large-scale characterization of the entire complement of proteins expressed by microbiota. However, metaproteomics analysis of clinical samples {% cite Metaproteomics_community_effort %} {% cite Jagtap2015 %} is challenged by the presence of abundant human (host) proteins which hampers the confident detection of lower abundant microbial proteins. To address this, we used tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and bioinformatics tools on the Galaxy platform to develop a metaproteomics workflow to characterize the metaproteomes of clinical samples. This clinical metaproteomics workflow holds potential for general clinical applications such as potential secondary infections during COVID infection, microbiome changes during cystic fibrosis as well as broad research questions regarding host-microbe interactions. The Galaxy-P team has developed a workflow wherein a large database is generated by downloading protein sequences of known disease-causing micro-organisms (figure 1)and  then generating a compact database from the comprehensive database using the Metanovo tool.
=======
General introduction about the topic and then an introduction of the
tutorial (the questions and the objectives). It is nice also to have a
scheme to sum up the pipeline used during the tutorial. The idea is to
give to trainees insight into the content of the tutorial and the (theoretical
and technical) key concepts they will learn.

You may want to cite some publications; this can be done by adding citations to the
bibliography file (`tutorial.bib` file next to your `tutorial.md` file). These citations
must be in bibtex format. If you have the DOI for the paper you wish to cite, you can
get the corresponding bibtex entry using [doi2bib.org](https://doi2bib.org).

With the example you will find in the `tutorial.bib` file, you can add a citation to
this article here in your tutorial like this:
{% raw %} `{% cite Batut2018 %}`{% endraw %}.
This will be rendered like this: {% cite Batut2018 %}, and links to a
[bibliography section](#bibliography) which will automatically be created at the end of the
tutorial.

# Pretreatment
=======
Give some background about what the trainees will be doing in the section.
Remember that many people reading your materials will likely be novices,
so make sure to explain all the relevant concepts.

## Title for a subsection
Section and subsection titles will be displayed in the tutorial index on the left side of
the page, so try to make them informative and concise!

# Hands-on Sections
Below are a series of hand-on boxes, one for each tool in your workflow file.
Often you may wish to combine several boxes into one or make other adjustments such
as breaking the tutorial into sections, we encourage you to make such changes as you
see fit, this is just a starting point :)

Anywhere you find the word "***TODO***", there is something that needs to be changed
depending on the specifics of your tutorial.

have fun!

It comes first a description of the step: some background and some theory.
Some image can be added there to support the theory explanation:

The idea is to keep the theory description before quite simple to focus more on the practical part.

# Conclusion

The first step for the Clinical Metaproteomics study is database generation. As we didn’t have a reference database or information from 16srRNA-seq data, we generated a fasta database doing a literature survey, however, if 16D rRNA data is present, the taxon identified can be used for a customized database generation. As the size of the comprehensive database is generally  too large, we used the Metanovo tool to reduce the size of the database. This reduced database will be then used for clinical metaproteomics discovery workflow.
